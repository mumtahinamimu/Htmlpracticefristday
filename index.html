	<h1>Let's Talk about Html Tag:</h1>

	<h3>Html Tag start with < > and close with < / >. This is called element or Close tag</h3>

	<h1>Let's see some about Html Tag like h1-h6:</h1>

	<p>There are 6type heading tag h1-h6 which are smaller gradually</p>

	<img src="images/handptag.jpg">

	<h1>This is h1 tag that means large heading</h1>

	<h2>This is h2 tag that is smaller than h1</h2>

	<h3>This is h3 tag that is smaller than h2</h3

	<h4>This is h4 tag that is smaller than h3</h4>

	<h5>This is h5 tag that is smaller than h4</h5>

	<h6>This is h6 tag that is smaller than h5</h5>

	<p>This is p tag in which we write paragraph</p>

	<h1>Let's talk about Image Tag:</h1>

	<img src="images/im.jpg">

	<p>Image tag is a open tag or self closing tag. It has 2 atribute a)src and B)alt</p>

	<p>In the src atribute we write image location like <h2>images/picturename.jpg </h2> we should use download images for using website and keep the images in image folder.</p> 

	<p>we should use medium resulation image so that the image is not blur or not take more time for loading.</p> 

	<p>That means the images should be some kb. we should use copyrightfree images from some freestock website like pixels.com, pixabay.com and unplash.com</p>
